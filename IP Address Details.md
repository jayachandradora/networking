# IP Address Details

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.

## IPv4 vs IPv6

- **IPv4**: The most common version of IP addresses, expressed as four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IPv4 addresses consist of 32 bits, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
  
- **IPv6**: A newer version of IP addresses designed to overcome the limitations of IPv4. IPv6 addresses are expressed as eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 addresses consist of 128 bits, providing a vastly larger address space.

## IP Address Components

- **Network Address**: Identifies the network portion of the address, determining the network to which the device belongs.
  
- **Host Address**: Identifies the specific device (host) within the network.

- **Subnet Mask**: Defines the boundary between the network and host portions of the IP address. It helps in determining which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host.

- **Prefix Length**: Represented as a number after a slash (/) in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. It specifies the number of bits in the network portion of the address.

## Classes of IP Addresses

- **Class A**: Used for large networks with a large number of hosts.
- **Class B**: Used for medium-sized networks.
- **Class C**: Used for small networks.

## Private vs Public IP Addresses

- **Private IP Addresses**: Reserved for use within private networks and are not routable on the public Internet.
- **Public IP Addresses**: Assigned by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and are routable on the public Internet.

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- **DHCP**: A network management protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices within a network. It automates the process of IP address configuration, eliminating the need for manual assignment.

IP addresses play a critical role in the functioning of the Internet and computer networks, enabling devices to communicate with each other across vast distances.
